Project #2

    http://eve.kean.edu/~zmudaja/project_2/store.html

    Description: A front-end prototype of an E-commerce website. Incorporated Bootstrap. Simple design. I wanted to have something that looked modern and would work 
    as a template for any sort of product. Working on the e-commerce site made me realize the decisions made by web designers as i took insparation from 
    the Apple Store design.

Project #3 (Final Project)

    http://eve.kean.edu/~zmudaja/final_project/index.html

    Description: A complete "Web Dev Story" that adopts a Design Thinking approach to address a problem through a front-end website build.
    I created a website dedicated to having a easy place to access information on Covid. It was fun working on making something that can actually help people. 
    The website was designed in a way to be easy to understand and read by anyone. Instead of having just text or overloading information i present the most
    important info in a clean way. There are links to even more information if needed.
